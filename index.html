      <h3>Intro</h3>
      <p>Hi. I'm Ilia Ershov (he/him), and I'm a backend software engineer.</p>

      <h3>Skills</h3>
      <p>I do backend development in C#/.NET, but also have experience with Java and Scala.</p>
      <p>I can also collect information I need and come up with tasks myself, not just close the tickets</p>
      <p>CI/CD pipeline configuration, setting up K8s/Helm releases and deploying and managing stuff I do are also nothing scary for me.</p>
      <p>Neither is working with databases (mostly PostgreSQL in practice), including query optimisations.</p>
      <p>I speak English, German and Russian.</p>
      <p>Professionally I develop my software cloud-first, as Docker images to be deployed in Kubernetes and using infrastructure provided by AWS or Microsoft Azure, for my pet projects I prefer to self-host and keep everything on a Linux VPS running as native Unix daemons.</p>

      <h3>Pet projects</h3>
      <p><a href="https://github.com/FileJunkie/KMyMoney.Net">KMyMoney.Net</a> is a tool I built for myself to edit <a href="https://kmymoney.org/">KMyMoney</a>'s data file from my phone.</p>
      <p>It is an app written in C#/.NET which is deployed as a Telegram bot accessing the said .kmy file stored in DropBox and storing its settings in an etcd cluster. It is packaged into a .deb file and deployed into VPS's I rent.</p>

      <h3>Professional aspirations</h3>
      <p>One of the directions I would like to take is growing towards being a software architect.</p>
      <p>Another one is getting closer to developing C#'s core libraries and frameworks, or switching to Linux kernel programming.</p>

      <h3>Hiring options</h3>
      <p>I am located in Germany and hold German citizenship, not actively looking for a job, but always interested in new opportunities.</p>
      <p>I can be interested in offers of following types:</p>

      <h3>Hobbies</h3>
      <p>While at my computer, I like tinkering with my VPSes, managing private VPN instances I host there and moving towards self-hosting where possible. I also like getting computers on various non-x86 architectures just to see how easy (or not) is it to install Gentoo on them. Tried out ARM (duh), PowerPC32 and RISC-V already.</p>
      <p>Outside of IT, I like traveling, especially to huge cities in East Asia, playing my bass guitar, creating short musical ideas, analyzing music, and collecting tons of trivia in my mind.</p>
